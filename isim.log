ERROR: at 125 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "/home/pin3da/Repos/Processor/RegisterFile_module.vhd" Line 44. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
